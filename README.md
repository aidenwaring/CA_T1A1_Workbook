### Q1

Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time.
300 - 500

## Q2

Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- packets
  - A packet is a unit of data that is routed between two an origin and a destination within a packet-switched network. A packet contains two types of information - control information and user data. 
  Communication platforms such as TCP/IP frames the data into two components - the header, payload and trailer.
  The header stores data detailing the delivery of the packet to it's destination, whereas the payload is the message's contents and the trailer containing bits representing the end of the packet. *

  The concept of network packets were first introduced in the early 1960s when Paul Baran, computer scientist, wrote 'Distributed Adaptive Message Block Switching, introducing a routing method for the delivery of information as part of a research program at RAND corporation, which, at the time, was funded by the US Department of Defence. *

  However, it wasn't until 1965 when computer scientist Donald Davies furthered Baran's concepts into the delivery of a packet switching network, a method of grouping collections of data packets, and parsed to application software. This method was later implemented into early ARPRANET and became what is now considered the foundations of modern data communications and computer networks. *
 
- IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
An internet protocol address (IP address) 


- routers and routing
- domains and DNS

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.
50 - 100 words per dot point

## Q3

Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:

- TCP
- HTTP and HTTPS
- web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)

## Q4

Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each.
50 - 100 words on each data structure

## Q5

Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different.
100 - 200 words on each way the code is executed

## Q6

Identify TWO commonly used programming languages and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each.

## Q7

Identify TWO ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue.

List of topics containing ethical issues:

- access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs)
- intellectual property, copyright, and acknowledgement.
- criminal acts such as theft, fraud, trafficking and distribution of prohibited substances, terrorism
- GPS tracking data and other types of metadata, MAC addresses, hardware fingerprints
- freedom of thought, conscience, speech and the media
- aggressive sales and marketing practices designed to mislead and deceive consumers
- trading of shares on the stock exchange OR crypto-currencies

For each ethical issue identify a source of legal information relating to the ethical issue and discuss whether the law is helpful in assisting a developer to act in an ethical way. (Word count guide: 200 words max)

Conduct research into a case study of ONE of the ethical issues you have chosen discuss how an ethical IT professional should respond to the case study and how they might mitigate or prevent ethical breaches. (Word count guide: 400 - 600 words)

200 - 400 words for each ethical issue

## Q8

Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language
100

## Q9

Explain type coercion
100

## 10

Explain data types, using examples

A data type is an attribute of data used to represent the data. This attribute, or type, tells the computer system's compiler or interpreter how the information should be used. *
Data types define the operations and calculations that can be performed on the data.
In computer programming, data is often represented in a number of different formats. While the names and the way they are declared may differ slightly betweeen programming languages, the they represent the same type. Below are a list of examples of some basic programming data types:

* integer - non-fractional numbers
* float - floating point numbers represents fractional values (rational numbers)
* string - sequence of characters
* boolean - true or false
* array - collection or store of a number of elements

# Q11

Here’s the problem: “There is a restaurant serving a variety of food. The customers want to be able to buy food of their choice. All the staff just quit, how can you build an app to replace them?”

- Identify the classes you would use to solve the problem
- Write a short explanation of why you would use the classes you have identified
  N/A

## Q12

Identify and explain the error in the code snippet below that is preventing correct execution of the program
100

## Q13

The code snippet below looks for the first two elements that are out of order and swaps them; however, it is not producing the correct results. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.
N/A

## Q14

Demonstrate your algorithmic thinking through completing the following two tasks, in order:

1.  Create a flowchart to outline the steps for listing all prime numbers between 1 and 100 (inclusive). Your flowchart should make use of standard conventions for flowcharts to indicate processes, tasks, actions, or operations
2.  Write pseudocode for the process outlined in your flowchart
    N/A

## Q15

Write pseudocode OR Ruby code for the following problem:
You have access to two variables: raining (boolean) and temperature (integer). If it’s raining and the temperature is less than 15 degrees, print to the screen “It’s wet and cold”, if it is less than 15 but not raining print “It’s not raining but cold”. If it’s greater than or equal to 15 but not raining print “It’s warm but not raining”, and otherwise tell them “It’s warm and raining”.
N/A

## Q16

An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for). The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:

- eggs (1)
- peanuts (2)
- shellfish (4)
- strawberries (8)
- tomatoes (16)
- chocolate (32)
- pollen (64)
- cats (128)

So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them:
a) whether or not they’re allergic to a given item
b) the full list of allergies.
